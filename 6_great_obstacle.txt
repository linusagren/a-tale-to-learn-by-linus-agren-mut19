Our heroes have to overcome a great obstacle that stands in the path of their epic journey.
A giant boulder blocks the road. Bob says: "I got this!", and lets out a high-pitched scream while trying to lift the boulder.
Bob's scawny body cannot handle the pressure and he passes out immediately.
His nose hits a hidden button and the boulder explodes.
Good job, Bob!
