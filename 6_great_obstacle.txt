Our heroes have to overcome a great obstacle that stands in the path of their epic journey.
A giant boulder blocks the road. Bob says: "I got this!", and lets out a high-pitched scream while trying to lift the boulder.
Bob's scawny body cannot handle the pressure and he passes out immediately.
His very skinny and pointy nose hits the boulder and destroys it.
Good job, Bob!
